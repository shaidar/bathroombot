Bathroom door sensor with Slack integration to notify you of bathroom availability.

### Problem
I work on a first floor of a building that only has a single bahtroom on that floor to accomodate around 30 people. Over the past few years, I've left my desk and walked to the bathroom, that's located in the middle of the hallway, only to discover that it's occupied. Given that I'm an optimist, most of the time I opted to wait as opposed to go to the second floor or next door to use the bathroom. That led to a lot of wasted time and decreased productivity and I finally decided to do something about it.
